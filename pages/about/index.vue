              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
            </p>
            <p>
              The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
